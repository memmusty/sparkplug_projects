	<p>Hi, I am <b>Memunat A. Ibrahim</b>, a Federal University Lokoja graduate of Computer Science. I love travelling, researching, anything adventurous in general; oh, I also love programming, photography, and repairing electronics (though, am not an engineer).I have interest in almost everything, I just love learning new things, and I can be very inquisitive. I am a critic,Ifind faults in things so easily that my friends call me an analyst (that analyses everything); I dont know if I should call that a gift or talent. Speaking of talents, I dont really know what my talents are, but I know I am multi-talented. I easily learn things, maybe its becauseIeasily understand things. <br>
	Regarding programming, I have experience with visual basic, c, c++, java, html, css, javascript, php, mysql, lex, yacc, and micro-controllers programming. However, I work mostly with php, mysql, and java.<br> I have no professional experience yet, and hope to get much experienced soon. That's all I can think of for now, Bye!<br><b>Oh! before you go, enjoy the featured video at the rightward part of the page.</p>
